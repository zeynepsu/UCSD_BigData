      "This class holds and manipulates information regarding:\n",
      " - **stations** (coordinates, weights)\n",
      " - partitioning of the world in **rectangle** areas\n",
      " - partitioning of the world in **groups** of rectangle areas\n",
      " \n",
      "In more detail, the **constructor** of this class takes as input:\n",
      " - the **station** dataframe that we computed in `01_Station_Weights.ipynb`, and\n",
      " - the **level** of the Hierarchical Indexing structure, which is a *k-d-tree*\n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "####Map partitioning\n",
      "The goal of the hierarchical partitioning of the data is that siblings (in our case\n",
      "**rectangle** areas) are close\n",
      "to each other and leaves have a similar \"weight\". \n",
      "\n",
      "Method `run` does the partitioning. It takes as input the boundaries of an area and \n",
      "splits it either \n",
      "horizontally or vertically (this choice alternates as we move deeper in the structure).\n",
      "The point at which the split happens is such that the cumulative weight of the \n",
      "stations in either side is *about* the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "This process results in the partitioning of the world in rectangles of about the same\n",
      "total weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the partitioning of the map in rectangles, there is also a partitioning \n",
      "into **groups**. Initially these two partionings are exactly the same. However, as \n",
      "our analysis procedes we might be able to merge two **neighboring** groups into a \n",
      "single one. For this reason we need to keep information for group that contains \n",
      "among others: \n",
      " - the rectangles that comprise it, and\n",
      " - the neighboring groups\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "####Merging of groups\n",
      "One of the main operations that can be performed on the HI structure is merging of \n",
      "groups. This operation is only possible between beighboring groups. Two groups are \n",
      "*neighboring* if they share some portion of their boundaries. After merging, we need \n",
      "to update the dataframe that keeps track of the station information, as new station\n",
      "ids are introduced and neighbors might change.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Local Properties Description\n",
      "\n",
      "* **`_stations`**: a dataframe with the original station information (immutable)  \n",
      "* **`_levels`**: the number of levels of the *k-d-tree*\n",
      "* **`_grouped_stations`**: dataframe containing station information, including the group\n",
      "    that the station belong to at all times. This structure gets updated at merging of\n",
      "    groups.\n",
      "* **`_rectangles`**: dataframe indexed by the `id` for each rectangle of the original \n",
      "    partitioning of the global map. This structure remains invariant after initialization.\n",
      "* **`_groups`**: dictionary indexed by the group `id`, containing information about each \n",
      "    group (neighbors, weight, included rectangles). Gets updated at group merging.\n",
      "* **`_computed`**: boolean value designatingif the original partition is done.\n",
      "* **`_neighbors`**: boolean square matrix indexed by rectangle ids at rows and columns. \n",
      "    A cell in this matrix is `True` if the indexing rectangles are neighboring, `False` \n",
      "    otherwise.\n",
      "* **`_gid_counter`**: counter used to provide \"fresh\" group ids at merging\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "##Main Methods Descriptions\n",
      "* **`get_grouped_stations()`**: returns the station dataframe of the **current** grouping\n",
      "    of stations (i.e. taking into account previous merges)\n",
      "* **`get_neighbors_of_group(i)`**: returns the **current** neighbors of group `i`.\n",
      "* **`groups_are_neighbors(i,j)`**: returns `True` if groups `i` and `j` are currently \n",
      "    neighbors\n",
      "* **`merge_groups(i,j)`**: perform a merge of groups `i` and `j`. These groups need to be\n",
      "    neighboring otherwise nothing will happen. This method takes care of all the accounting \n",
      "    outlined above, and returns the id of the new group that gets created.\n",
